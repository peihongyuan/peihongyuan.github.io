I am an information and coding theory researcher at the Institute of Space Internet, Fudan University, China, where I joined as an Assistant Professor in 2025. I received the Dr.-Ing. degree (Ph.D. equivalent) in electrical and computer engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, in 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Gerhard Kramer, and the M.Sc. degree from TUM in 2015. From 2022 to 2025, I was a postdoctoral associate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Prof. Muriel MÃ©dard.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
