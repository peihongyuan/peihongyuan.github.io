I am an information and coding theory researcher at the Institute of Space Internet, Fudan University, China, where I joined as an Assistant Professor in 2025. I received the Dr.-Ing. degree (Ph.D. equivalent) in electrical and computer engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, in 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Gerhard Kramer, and the M.Sc. degree from TUM in 2015. From 2022 to 2025, I was a postdoctoral associate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Prof. Muriel Médard.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the areas of information theory, coding theory, and applied probability, with a particular focus on modern channel coding, network coding, and their applications in wireless, optical fiber, and space communications.

Openings
======
I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D. and Master’s students, research interns, and postdoctoral researchers to join our group, particularly those with an interest in coding theory, probabilistic shaping, and satellite communication networks. If you are interested, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts.
